# Sauerbraten SDL2 Client

SDOS based sauerbraten client for windows/linux with build system
changes and some performance/compatibility improvements.  Also some
additional visual options, that have been missing for years are
provided (all of them are diabled by default and separate config files
are used). Use "extendedsettings" command for configuring.
